# Happiness_Project

The Happiness Project aims to predict the level of happiness of a population, country by country, based on 
general information (GDP, level of corruption, level of freedom of the country's inhabitants, etc.). This GitHub repository consists of a world-happiness-report-2021.csv file containing the data and a world_happiness.ipynb notebook containing the code related to the project.
The project is open source and available on GitHub.
